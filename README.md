# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about all things Python, data science, and the fascinating world of machine and deep learning.

## What I'm Up To 🚀

* Diving deep into Python, C++, PyTorch, and NumPy.
* Currently on a learning adventure with C++, Git, CUDA, computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP). I'm also brushing up on algorithms and data structures – because why not?
* Sharing my LeetCode solutions.
* Keeping track of my coding projects (because organization is key).
* Always open to collaborations!

## My Projects 🛠️

* **Object Detection Algorithms:** I've implemented R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv3 from scratch. Yes, from scratch! It was a wild ride, but totally worth it.
* **Language Models for Math Questions:** I've trained and fine-tuned language models to solve math questions at an 8th-grade level. It made my GPU go crazy.
* **Deep Learning Projects:** Exploring various deep learning projects, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## LeetCode Adventures 🧗

* I regularly publish my LeetCode solutions. If you're stuck on a problem, maybe my solution can help. Or maybe you can help me improve mine!
* C++ solutions coming soon, stay tuned!

Thanks for stopping by! Happy coding! 💻✨
